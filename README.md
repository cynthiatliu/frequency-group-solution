# frequency-group-solution

So far the best solution I have to classifying lattice structures given Miller indices. The only somewhat troubling area is the distinction between I and P (body-centered and primitive). Otherwise, the program is great and should be resistent to noise as the difference between the frequency arrays for most pairs of structures is large and very visible and small changes minimally interfere with the larger pattern.
