# frequency-group-solution

After reducing the number of layers in the nueral net for individual point classification (from 4 to 3), I pretty much have ideal results. The frequencies for the group labels are perfect for all structures except primitive, and there is only one incorrectly labelled label group in primitive (note: I tried to visually determine the difference between that one group and other primitive groups, and there seems nothing special about it). So yay!
